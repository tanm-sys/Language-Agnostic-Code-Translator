# Language-Agnostic Code Translator

## Overview

The Language-Agnostic Code Translator is a versatile tool designed to translate code snippets between different programming languages. It supports a wide range of language features, including block structures, functions, classes, inheritance, and more.

## Features

- **Language Support**: Translate code between various programming languages, making it language-agnostic.
- **Code Parsing**: Tokenize and parse source code to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for better understanding of code structure.
- **AST Translation**: Translate the AST to the target language, preserving the semantics of the original code.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the translator to support additional programming languages and language features.

## How It Works

1. **Tokenization**: The source code is tokenized to identify keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, comments, and other language constructs.

2. **AST Construction**: The tokenized code is used to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the hierarchical structure of the code.

3. **Translation**: The AST is translated to the target language based on a mapping of language constructs.

4. **Output**: The translated code is generated and can be used in the target programming environment.

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    CodeTranslator translator;

    std::string cppCode = R"(
        // This is a C++ function
        int add(int a, int b) {
            /* Multi-line comment */
            return a + b;
        }
    )";

    std::string pythonCode = translator.translateCode(cppCode, "cpp", "python");

    std::cout << "C++ Code:" << std::endl << cppCode << std::endl << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Translated to Python:" << std::endl << pythonCode << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
